# Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation metrics are important to check the effectiveness of our model in real world situations, (i.e., on seen and unseen data).

# Eavluation Metrics are Different for Classification and Regression Models

### Evaluation Metrics for Classification
- Accuracy
- Precision (P)
- Recall (R)
- F1 score (F1)
- Area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve or simply Area Under Curve (AUC)
- Log loss
- Precision at k (P@k)
- Average precision at k (AP@k)
- Mean average precision at k (MAP@k)

### Evaluation Metrics for Regression
- Mean absolute error (MAE)
- Mean squared error (MSE)
- Root mean squared error (RMSE)
- Root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE)
- Mean percentage error (MPE)
- Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
- R-square (R^2)

# A BIG NOTE !!!

```md
Logistic Regression falls under CLASSIFICATION BASED ALGORITHMS. 
Thus, we will apply only Classification based metrics on this.
