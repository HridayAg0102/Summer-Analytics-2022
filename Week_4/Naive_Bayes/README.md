- This Algorithm used `Bayes Theorem` as its base algorithm.
- It is a faster classification type algorithm, compared to other algorithms when **few variables** but **large number of entries** are there.
- This algorithm is mostly used in text classification and with problems having multiple classes.

## Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers
Naive Bayes Classifiers are classified into three categories â€”

i) Gaussian Naive Bayes

This classifier is employed when the predictor values are continuous and are expected to follow a Gaussian distribution.

ii) Bernoulli Naive Bayes

When the predictors are boolean in nature and are supposed to follow the Bernoulli distribution, this classifier is utilized.

iii) Multinomial Naive Bayes

This classifier makes use of a multinomial distribution and is often used to solve issues involving document or text classification.
