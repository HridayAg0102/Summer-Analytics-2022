### Applications:

i) Gradient Boosting Algorithm is generally used when we want to decrease the Bias error.

ii) Gradient Boosting Algorithm can be used in regression as well as classification problems. In regression problems, the cost function is MSE whereas, in classification problems, the cost function is Log-Loss.
